# Document Site


How to get working:

- clone this repo
- run `npm i` in the dir
- install firebase cli
- make a new firebase project
- get the projects name (you can get this by running  `firebase projects:list`
- clone `.firebaserc example` (in the frontend folder) and replace `Your project name here` with your projects name
- go back to the main dir and run `npm run dev` or `npm run dev-fe` for runing the site
